> Detects blue cars, counts vehicles, and counts people at traffic signals â€” all in **real-time**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project uses **YOLO object detection** combined with a **colour classification model** to detect cars at a traffic signal and determine their colour.  
- **Blue cars** â†’ Highlighted with **red bounding boxes**  
- **Other cars** â†’ Highlighted with **blue bounding boxes**  
- **People** â†’ Counted and displayed on-screen  

Itâ€™s useful for **traffic monitoring, enforcement, and analytics**.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- ðŸš— **Colour-specific car detection** (blue vs other colours)  
- ðŸŸ¥ Red bounding box for blue cars, ðŸŸ¦ blue bounding box for others  
- ðŸ‘¥ People counting at traffic signals  
- ðŸ“Š Real-time display of **car count + people count**  
- âš¡ Works with live camera or video files

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **OpenCV** for image & video processing  
- **YOLO** for car & person detection  
- **NumPy** for data handling  
- **Pillow** for image preprocessing  

---

## ðŸ“œ How It Works  
1. **Detection** â†’ YOLO detects cars & people in each frame  
2. **Classification** â†’ Car colours are identified (blue or not)  
3. **Bounding Boxes** â†’  
   - Blue cars â†’ Red boxes  
   - Other cars â†’ Blue boxes  
4. **Counting** â†’ Number of cars & people displayed live
